## Azure Governance with Azure Policy & Blueprints Lab

As part of my hands-on Azure cloud security portfolio, this lab demonstrates the enforcement of cloud governance using **Azure Policy** and **Blueprints**.  
It automates security controls, prevents configuration drift and validates compliance posture at scale.

## Overview

This lab demonstrates automated enforcement of governance and compliance in Azure environments using **Azure Policy** and **Blueprints**.

I authored and assigned policies to:
- Prevent public IP exposure.
- Enforce tagging conventions.

I then bundled these policies into an **Azure Blueprint** with a predefined resource group and deployed it to test governance-as-code in action.

---

## Real-World Risk

- Cloud misconfigurations (e.g., public IPs, missing tags) are a top cause of breaches.
- Manual reviews don’t scale—organizations need automation.
- Compliance-as-code is essential for repeatable, auditable environments.

---

## What I Built

- Created a **custom Azure Policy** to block public IP creation.
- Assigned a **built-in tag policy** to enforce the `Environment` tag on all resources.
- Packaged these into a reusable **Azure Blueprint** with an embedded resource group.
- Assigned the blueprint to a subscription, deploying governance automatically.
- Verified enforcement by triggering and capturing **policy denial errors**.
- Tracked compliance results via the **Azure Policy dashboard**.

## Objectives

- Prevent non-compliant infrastructure via policy-as-code.  
- Automate resource governance using blueprints.
- Demonstrate enforcement through blocked deployments.  
- Prove compliance visibility through Azure dashboards.  

---

## Steps Performed

**1. Resource Group Setup**  
   - Created `rg-policy-lab` to test early policy assignments.  
   - Confirmed its creation before applying scope-level enforcement *(Screenshot: `resource-group-created.png`)*

**2. Custom Policy Definition**  
   - Authored a JSON policy (`Deny-Public-IP`) to block creation of public IP addresses.  
   - Used Azure CLI to create the custom policy definition *(Screenshot: `custom-policy-definition.png`)*

**3. Policy Assignment (Custom & Built-in)**  
   - Assigned `Deny-Public-IP` to `rg-policy-lab` scope.  
   - Assigned built-in policy `Require a tag on resources` with parameter `Environment` *(Screenshots: `policy-assignment-basics.png`, `policy-assignment-review.png`, `tag-policy-assignment-basics.png`, `tag-policy-parameters.png` & `tag-policy-review.png`)*

**4. Manual Enforcement Testing**  
   - Attempted to create:
     - Public IP in `rg-policy-lab` → Denied (proves Deny-Public-IP works)  
     - Storage Account without `Environment` tag → Denied (proves tag policy works)*(Screenshots: `policy-enforcement-public-ip-error.png` & `tag-policy-enforcement-error.png`)*

**5. Compliance Dashboard Validation**  
   - Used Policy > Compliance to track enforcement results.  
   - Scoped to `rg-policy-lab` and confirmed policy effect *(Screenshot: `compliance-dashboard-updated.png`)*

**6. Azure Blueprint Creation**  
   - Created blueprint `secure-rg-blueprint` with:
     - Resource Group: `rg-secured-env`.
     - Deny-Public-IP policy.
     - Require Environment tag policy *(Screenshots: `blueprint-basics.png` & `blueprint-artifact-list.png`)*

**7. Blueprint Assignment**  
   - Published version `v1.0` of the blueprint.  
   - Assigned the blueprint to the subscription with:
     - Tag: `Environment`.
     - Location: `East US` *(Screenshots: `blueprint-assignment-parameters.png` & `blueprint-published-overview.png`)*

**8. Post-Blueprint Enforcement Test**  
   - Attempted to deploy:
     - Public IP in `rg-secured-env` → Denied by blueprint-assigned policy.  
     - Untagged Storage Account in `rg-secured-env` → Denied *(Screenshots: `policy-denial-public-ip.png` & `policy-denial-storage-no-tag.png`)*

**9. Compliance Confirmation (Blueprint Scope)**  
   - Scoped the Compliance Dashboard to `rg-secured-env`.  
   - Verified that blueprint-assigned policies were active and compliant *(Screenshot: `blueprint-compliance-status.png`)*

**10. Cleanup**  
   - Confirmed deployment of `rg-secured-env` via Blueprint.  
   - Deleted `rg-policy-lab` if no longer needed.  
   - Retained blueprint and assignment for demonstration purposes.

## Lessons Learned

- Governance must be **automated** to scale securely in the cloud.
- Custom + built-in policies are powerful when combined.
- Blueprints provide **reusable governance bundles** with defined scopes.
- Testing policy effects (denials) proves enforcement, not just intent.

---

## Notes and Considerations

- Azure Blueprints are being deprecated July 2026 → migrate to **Template Specs** in the future.
- Policy compliance state may take 5–15 minutes to update after deployment.
- "Not started" status means no matching resource exists yet.
